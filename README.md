# money.ex

Very simple library for money representation in Elixir.

This was made for personal use in a toy project. It's not battle tested and is
feature incomplete. I do not suggest using it in your projects.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:money, "~> 0.1.0"}, # If published to Hex
    {:money, github: "dideler/money.ex"},
    {:money, git: "https://github.com/dideler/money.ex.git", tag: "0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
